This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![plot of chunk pressure](figure/pressure-1.png)


## Testing the image with an R chunk from a png file

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](./ir.clubname.ovr.png)

## Testing the image with an R chunk from ggplot object

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Testing an image with HTML image inserting
This is a test to insert an image to the report
